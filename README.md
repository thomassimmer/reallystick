## Firebase Setup for Notifications

To enable notifications (WebSocket/Push), you need **two Firebase configuration files**:

1. A **Firebase service account JSON file** (for backend authentication with FCM).
2. A **`google-services.json`** file (for Android apps).

---

### **1. Firebase Service Account (Backend)**

This file is required for backend authentication with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

#### **Steps to Generate Your Own File:**

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click **"Add Project"** and follow the instructions.

2. **Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**:

   - In your project, go to **Project Settings > Cloud Messaging**.
   - Ensure FCM is enabled.

3. **Generate a Service Account Key**:

   - Go to **Project Settings > Service Accounts**.
   - Click **"Generate New Private Key"** (this downloads a `.json` file).
   - Rename the file to:
     ```
     reallystick-firebase-adminsdk.json
     ```

4. **Place the File**:
   - Copy the `.json` file to the **root of the `backend/notifications/` directory**.

---

### **2. `google-services.json` (Android)**

This file is required for Firebase integration in Android apps.

#### **Steps to Generate and Place the File:**

1. **Register Your Android App in Firebase**:

   - In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), go to your project.
   - Click **"Add App"** and select **Android**.
   - Enter the package name `com.reallystick`.
   - Follow the instructions to register your app.

2. **Download `google-services.json`**:
   - After registering, Firebase will prompt you to download `google-services.json`.
   - Save this file in:
     ```
     frontend/android/app/google-services.json
     ```
